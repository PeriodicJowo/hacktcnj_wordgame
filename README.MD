# hacktcnj_wordgame
A two player customizable word guessing game

# LONG DESCRIPTION!
This code consists of two players. 
Only one player will be able to look at the code. 
This code was made for the purpose of being a game generator. 
The first player (the person who chooses the word) will be given some directions. 
After player 1 chooses the word, the code will tell player 1 what to say. 
Everything is done by the computer. 
Player 1 is given the length of the word which is told to player 2. 
Player 2 guesses the word. 
If player 2 gets it wrong, player 2 is given the option of using a hint. 
If player 2 chooses yes for a hint, player 1 is presented with a bunch of hints that player 1 can choose to tell or not to tell player 2. 
(Whether what player 1 entered was in the secret word, what the word starts with, what the word ends with). 
After player 2 guesses the word, the game ends. They are given a choice if they'd like to continue
